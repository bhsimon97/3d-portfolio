# Ben Simon's Portfolio

Hello! This is a portfolio website that I built using React, JavaScript, Three.js, and EmailJS. I used Vite as a development server and hosted it on GitHub Pages at https://bhsimon97.github.io/3d-portfolio/. Additionally, there is a behind-the-scenes Actions workflow which acts as a pseudo-CI/CD pipeline -- any time I push something to this master branch, the application automatically redeploys and the hosted content is updated accordingly. Definitely a cool little feature!
